# xmlblog

Just a minimal blog/template system I coded to be able to publish a few lines and maybe a picture from my holidays.

## Dependencies

A webserver with working python cgi. (Add "index.cgi" to DirectoryIndex).

## Usage

Modify settings.xml to match your prefered language, title, links and stuff.

Every blog post is stored in an .xml file in the "items" folder. Syntax is pretty much self explanatory.

There is no web-interface of any kind. Just edit the xml files.

You could also clone this repo, customize it, and make the webserver pull updates automatically from you local repo. This way you can publish posts using git commits.

## Claim

This is nothing even remotely professional. Just needed something to be able to git-push blogposts.
